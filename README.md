The application allows interacting with one or groups in the same “snippet” of the code in a video conference experience chat and live text editor with the final purpose of take place of some programming exercise. It’s allowed various programming languages in a live code editor that allows synchronization in real time.

## Challenges

- Find a new way to use Messenger Bot to connect people.
- Build a useful live code editor
- Achieve perfect code edition synchrony using websockets

## What's next for live-coding-circle
- Live Code execution, using docker images to run containers with the main stacks in the live session.
- Video & Audio streaming to improve the experience
-Allow to embed an snippet in another site
